# chomprl 🍫🤖  

a chomp bot that tries its best. it is very (very) dumb. please be nice to it.  

## warning ⚠️  

this bot **will** make terrible decisions. it genuinely cannot play well. if you go easy on it, it might win... probably. uh, it does have some survival instinct, and seems to get the game mechanic, so yay! i might train a better one later. maybe. if i learn enough rl.

## how to play 🎮  

1. clone this repo and `cd` into it:  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/icingtea/chomprl.git  
   cd chomprl  
   ```  
2. install dependencies:  
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  
3. run the game:  
   ```sh
   python main.py  
   ```  
4. pick a square. bot picks a square. try not to eat the poisoned piece. if you do, you lose. if the bot does, you win. you will probably win.
